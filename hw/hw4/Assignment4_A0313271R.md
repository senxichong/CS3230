**Q1**
 **solution**:
 (a): the probablity is 1/2.Proof:because $A[i]$ is random number for any i and $A[i]$ $\neq$ b,Hence there are $n-i+1$ numbers that greater or smaller that b for a fixed i.And both cases' probablities are equal. So we can assume there are $(n-i+1)/2$ numbers greater than b for a fixed i.For the case that $A[i]$ is greater than b is similar to pick up a number greater than b from the  $(n-i+1)$ numbers.Therefore,the probablity is 1/2
 (b): the number is $1+3/2*(n-2)$.Proof:the part I:only need one comparaion.The part two:all the $n-2$ numbers need to be compared with b. And only half of them need to be compared to a.
